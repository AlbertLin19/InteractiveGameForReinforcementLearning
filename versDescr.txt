03 session is model 1
04 session is model 2

the above are with -80 and 200 reward, 20000 mem, 32 batch, 0.9988 decay, 0.97 discount (gamma)
0.001 learning rate, conv 16, 1; conv 16, 3, strides=2; conv 32, 3, strides=2; flatten; dense 256; dense 4

and multiinput had additionally dense 16 and dense 16

05 sess is model 2, with no boardhistory bc 6000 games, reward changed to -100 and 300

since 05 just resulted in loops, 06 will have the new reward system +- 1
